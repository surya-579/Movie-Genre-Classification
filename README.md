# Movie-Genre-Classification

This repository contains code and resources for Movie Genre Classification.

## Introduction

Classifying movie genres is essential for various tasks in the film industry, such as recommendation systems, content tagging, and marketing strategies. This project aims to develop machine learning models to classify movie genres based on textual descriptions or other features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Movie-Genre-Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb).
It is included in the folder `Genre Classification Dataset`.

## Setup Instructions

To run the project code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/surya-579/Movie-Genre-Classification.git
    ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
3. Install the required Python libraries.
4. Open and run the `Credit_Card_Fraud_detection.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Results

The project evaluates the performance of various machine learning algorithms for classifying movie genres. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Insights into feature importance and model interpretability are also provided.

## Conclusion

Accurate movie genre classification can enhance user experiences in movie recommendation platforms and improve content organization in streaming services. This project serves as a demonstration of building and comparing predictive models for movie genre classification using machine learning techniques.
